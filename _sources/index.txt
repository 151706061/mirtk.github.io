Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK)
==========================================

The MIRTK is a research-focused image processing toolkit, developed at the
BioMedIA_ research group. It provides a collection of libraries and command-line
tools to assist in processing and analyzing imaging data.
The main application of the MIRTK is in adult and neonatal brain MR image registration
as well as the reconstruction of cortical surface meshes. The modular project
organization of the MIRTK enables the installation of selected modules.

In the event you found the MIRTK useful, please consider giving appropriate credit
to the software with a citation of the research article(s) describing the implemented
algorithm(s). See the :doc:`list of publications <publications>` for suitable references.

Parts of the Common, Numerics, Image, Transformation, and Registration modules of
the MIRTK originated from the `Legacy IRTK`_ written by `Daniel Rueckert`_ and `Julia Schnabel`_.
All of the transformation and registration code of the IRTK was rewritten from scratch by `Andreas Schuh`_
during his PhD studies, with a new modular and extended registration framework. Additional
modules for the reconstruction and inflation of cortical surface meshes, the registration
of surface meshes, and the harmonic mapping of brain volumes were subsequently added to the MIRTK.
The source code of the MIRTK library became the foundation of the `IRTK 2`_, whose development
is currently in progress.

.. note::

    Latest bug fixes and additional features are currently only available in the MIRTK.
    Other applications and command-line tools such as the image viewer, basic image manipulation
    tools, and the Segmentation module of the Legacy IRTK are not included in the MIRTK.
    An installation of the MIRTK will not be required as soon as a IRTK 2 release which
    includes all MIRTK modules is available. Until then, an installation of both the MIRTK
    and IRTK 2 is recommended.
