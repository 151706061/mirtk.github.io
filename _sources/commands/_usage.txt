Common usage
============

The MIRTK installs a single executable script file named ``mirtk`` in the
``bin/`` directory of the installation root directory. This executable is
used to execute the various MIRTK commands. The name of the command must
be specified as first argument of the ``mirtk`` executable. Help about
a command can be printed using the special ``help`` or ``help-rst`` commands
followed by the name of the command for which help is requested.

Usage::

    mirtk help <command>
    mirtk [-v] [-v] <command> [options]

When the ``-v`` option is given before the command name, the path and arguments
of the actual command executable is printed before command execution.

.. note:: The MIRTK installation includes a `Bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`__
          completions script which when sourced e.g. in your ``$HOME/.bashrc`` or
          ``$HOME/.profile`` shell configuration file, enables auto-completion of
          available MIRTK commands. To enable Bash completions for ``mirtk``, add the
          following line to your shell configuration file::

            . "$MIRTK_DIR/share/mirtk_bash_completions.sh"
