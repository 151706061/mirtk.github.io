Source Code
===========

The source code of the Medical Image Registration ToolKit (MIRTK) is hosted on GitHub
under the `MIRTK Organization <https://github.com/MIRTK/>`__ from which all releases and latest development
versions can be downloaded. See the :doc:`changelog` for a summary of changes in each release.

To download the MIRTK source files using Git_, use the following
`git clone <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone>`__ command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --depth 1 -- https://github.com/MIRTK/MIRTK.git
    MIRTK_SOURCE_DIR="$PWD/MIRTK"

where the ``--depth 1`` options request a shallow clone of the latest
release files excluding previous revisions in order to save bandwidth,
download time, and disk space. The ``--depth`` option may be omitted if you want to
see the development history and contribute to the MIRTK. To download the latest
development version, use the ``--branch develop`` option. Note that branches can be
switched also after the initial clone command using the
`git checkout <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout>`__ command.

Before running any of the following Git commands, you have to change to the root directory
of the downloaded MIRTK repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $MIRTK_SOURCE_DIR

.. note::

   To download the entire MIRTK distribution including documentation source files,
   third-party library modules, and external packages, run the command::

       git submodule update --init

   after the initial clone command without any directory path argument. To download
   only selected additional files, run one or more of the following commands.

The MIRTK repository includes copies of the Boost and Eigen library header files
required to build some of the core modules of the MIRTK. Either install these
libraries using the official installation packages for your operating system
or initialize the desired Git submodules before configuring the MIRTK build:

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init -- ThirdParty/Boost
    git submodule update --init -- ThirdParty/Eigen

The source files of core MIRTK modules are included in the top-level MIRTK repository
under the Modules/ subdirectory. Further optional modules which are developed and
distributed in their own respective Git repository are included as Git submodules
in the Packages/ directory. To also build these optional modules, initialize and
update the desired Git submodules before (re-)configuring the build files, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init -- Packages/Deformable
    git submodule update --init -- Packages/VolumetricMapping

To build the online documentation from the reStructuredText (.rst) files in
the Documentation subdirectory, clone also the MIRTK Documentation repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init -- Documentation
